# Van Le
I'm a full-stack developer with over two years of front-end experience at a digital agency, building websites with cutting-edge technology to communicate important issues. Whilst I do love crafting a slick user interface and fanciful animations, I'm looking for opportunities to contribute right across the stack.


| Curious mind, busy hands :raised_hands: |
|---|
| <p>I learn by throwing myself in the deep-end and using shiny new technology on real projects. I was incredibly interested in websockets, and learnt how to use the technology whilst building [a real-time multiplayer game](https://github.com/gtormiston/battlecodes). I enjoy deconstructing things and rebuilding them to understand how they work, much to my parents' dismay when I took my first computer apart. Rather than using an existing web framework, I opted to [build my own](https://github.com/vannio/unicorn-framework) using only default Node packages, in an attempt to further understand how a popular framework like Express works under the hood.</p><p>I always like to keep busy and am often working on a side project of some kind. Ask me what I'm working on now!</p>

| Problem solver :bulb: |
|---|
| Constantly learning new things comes with a multitude of problems. Luckily, I'm a fast, experienced debugger and can often pre-empt or foresee an upcoming issue. My degree in Chemistry does occasionally come into use as well! I take a scientific approach to solving a problem, starting off with a hypothesis and testing it out by intentionally breaking code (and subsequently fixing it, of course). I'm no stranger to puzzles and can even navigate my way around a rubix cube. |

| Completionist :100: |

| As well as trying to complete every side quest in Skyrim and Dragon Age, I enjoy seeing a project evolve from vague client specifications, through to a polished piece [worthy of industry recognition](http://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/hunger-in-america/27931/). My time as a front-end web developer at an agency has given me the opportunity to work on a large variety of projects, from well-organised CMS templates to elaborately animated narrative sites. I've been involved from the brainstorming stage right through to deployment, and it always gives me great pleasure to release work into _the wild_ for others to enjoy. |
