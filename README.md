I'm a full-stack developer with over two years of professional front-end experience. I started web development from an early age, styling MySpace profiles (I know...) and hobby websites. I pursued a degree in Chemistry, but just couldn't keep away from coding, and eventually returned to work at a digital agency as a front-end developer.

I've just completed a highly selective coding course at Makers Academy, practicing paired programming and TDD for cleaner, more modular code. Whilst I do love crafting a slick user interface and fanciful animations, I'm looking for exciting opportunities to contribute right across the stack and put my fantastic training to good use.

## Skills
#### Curious mind, busy hands :raised_hands:
I learn by throwing myself in the deep-end and using shiny new technology on real projects. I was incredibly interested in websockets, and learnt how to use the technology by building [a real-time multiplayer game](https://github.com/gtormiston/battlecodes).

I enjoy deconstructing things and rebuilding them to understand how they work, much to my parents' dismay when I took my first computer apart. Rather than using an existing web framework, I opted to [build my own](https://github.com/vannio/unicorn-framework) using only default Node packages, in an attempt to further understand how a popular framework like Express works under the hood.

I always like to keep busy and am often working on a side project of some kind. Ask me what I'm working on now!

#### Problem solver :bulb:
Constantly learning new things comes with a multitude of problems that are harder to debug because of their unfamiliarity. Luckily, I'm a fast, experienced debugger and can spot common patterns or pre-empt an upcoming issue.

My background in Chemistry comes into use surprisingly often. I've learnt to take a more scientific and systematic approach to solving a problem, starting off with a hypothesis and testing it out, either by writing unit tests or intentionally breaking code (and subsequently fixing it, of course). I'm no stranger to puzzles and can even navigate my way around a Rubik's cube.

#### Completionist :100:
As well as trying to complete every side quest in Skyrim and Dragon Age, I enjoy seeing a project evolve from vague client specifications, through to a polished piece [worthy of industry recognition](http://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/hunger-in-america/27931/). My time as a front-end web developer at an agency has given me the opportunity to work on a large variety of projects, from well-organised CMS templates to elaborately animated narrative sites. I've been involved from the brainstorming stage right through to deployment, and it always gives me great pleasure to release work into _the wild_ for others to enjoy.
