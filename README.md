I'm a **software developer** with **2+ years** of professional development experience. I started web development from an early age, styling MySpace profiles (I know...) and hobby websites. I pursued a degree in Chemistry, but just couldn't keep away from coding, and eventually returned to work at a digital agency as a front-end developer.

I recently completed an intensive software development course to further expand my skillset and learn best practices. I'm **looking for exciting opportunities** ✨ to contribute right across the stack and put my fantastic training to good use. I'm open to learning new programming languages as necessary.

## Skills
#### Curious mind :thought_balloon:
I learn by throwing myself in the deep-end and using shiny new technology on real projects. I was incredibly interested in websockets, and successfully learnt how to use the technology by building a [real-time multiplayer game](https://github.com/gtormiston/battlecodes).

#### Busy hands :raised_hands:
I enjoy deconstructing and rebuilding things to understand how they work, much to my parents' dismay when I took my first computer apart. In an attempt to further understand how a popular framework like Express works, I built [a web framework](https://github.com/vannio/unicorn-framework) from scratch, using only default Node packages for static file serving and HTTP requests. It even includes a custom-built template rendering engine.

I always like to keep busy and am often working on a side project of some kind. Ask me what I'm working on now!

#### Problem solver :bulb:
My background in Chemistry comes into use surprisingly often. I've learnt to take a more scientific and systematic approach to solving a problem, starting off with a hypothesis and testing it out, either by writing unit tests or intentionally breaking code (and subsequently fixing it, of course). I'm no stranger to puzzles and can even navigate my way around a Rubik's cube.

#### Completionist :100:
Once I commit to something, I give it my all. As well as trying to finish every side quest in Skyrim and Dragon Age, I complete projects as thoroughly as I can down to every last detail. I enjoy seeing projects evolve from vague client requirements through to a polished piece [worthy of industry recognition](http://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/hunger-in-america/27931/).
